# Instagram Auto Replier with Natural Language Processing

## About

Hosted [here](https://master.d14529d6qyf5xb.amplifyapp.com/) on AWS. (Preview below)

A web application targeted for Instagram business and creators account to automatically reply to comments to increase user engagement for Instagram's algorithm.
Comments from individual posts are passed into Google Clouds Platform's Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine their sentiments.
Users will be able to define a standard set of postive targeted and negative targeted replies as well as the sentiment value which they want to reply to. (Sentiment value ranges from -1 to 1)

Example:
 - Positive targeted replies for sentiments > 0.7:
    - Thank you for your support!
    - ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
    - Do come and visit us again!
 - Negative targeted replies for sentiments < -0.5:
    - Thank you for your feedback, we will strive to achieve a better experience for you.

Replies can either be cycled through or randomized to reduce the presence of a bot and to make replies more human.
